This repo only contains one file which demonstrates some of my ability in Python. This solution uses Gaussian Processes to predict outcomes of members from Column A vs members from Column B in a follow up season containing 300 results for each member of Column A.



The .csv used in the program has three columns (BID, PID & Result). The file included is a python file.
